Project 3  ray intersection.

Completed so far
 Implement the function "intersect" under the Sphere struct, to determine the intersection between a ray and the sphere.
intersect functions stores a, b and c values all these values are sent to quadratic equation to caluculate the quadratic function and minimun t value is stored at the end of intersection function

Phongs model.
amibient featues , diffuse nad specular concepts are added using normalizing light,reflection and viewieng vector points.
foor lopp is used to implement number of lights present in the graphics.

for recursive reflection 

new structure reflection is created and reflected ray is calculated and added to the colors.
